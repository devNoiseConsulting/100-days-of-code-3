## Doing It Again??

So I completed my [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://github.com/devNoiseConsulting/100-days-of-code) [twice](https://github.com/devNoiseConsulting/100-days-of-code-2).

I started doing some more [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) projects, but wasn't consistently working on them. So I'm starting up another log to help keep me focused.

## Goals

-   Complete freeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certification.
    -   I've completed the challenges and need to work on the projects. The estimated time for these projects could fill up a 100 Days of Code challenge by themselves.
-   If selected participate in the [Grow with Google US Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google).
